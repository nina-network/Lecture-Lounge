## Description

Project Description: Lecture Lounge is a web application designed to foster a more cohesive and interactive learning environment within the College of Computing and Informatics at UNC Charlotte. In traditional classroom settings, students often face barriers when seeking assistance from teaching assistants (TAs) or engaging in collaborative learning with peers. Lecture Lounge aims to bridge this gap by providing a centralized platform where students can easily connect with TAs and fellow classmates in real-time.

Through Lecture Lounge, students can ask questions, seek clarification on course materials, and engage in discussions with TAs and peers, all within an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The platform accommodates students of various personality types, including those who may be hesitant or shy in reaching out for help in traditional settings. By promoting open communication and fostering a sense of community, Lecture Lounge empowers students to take an active role in their learning journey and promotes collaborative learning experiences that enhance overall academic success.
